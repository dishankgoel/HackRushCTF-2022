# Ideas for challenges

1. Crypto

o Simple RSA challenge
o RSA with common prime
o Brute force the time of seed
o Meet in the middle attack with DES
o padding oracle attack with AES ECB

-> ECDSA challenge ?


2. Web Exploitation

-> PHP hash collision
-> Length extension attack with real web application (url params)
-> Passing array to bypass check
-> SQL Injection
-> Log4J
-> PHP serialization attack
-> lfi
-> template injection
-> CSP
-> shell upload

3. Reverse Engineering

o Simple if/else checks
o Crypto implemenation
o Not feasible to calculate key
o z3

-> Custom hash breaking
-> Dynamically injecting code?

4. Binary Exploitation

o Normal overflow
o Integer overflow
o Canary overflow
o ret2libc
o Format string for global flag
o Format string with GOT table

-> use after free?
-> off by one?


5. Misc

o Discord welcome flag (flag done)
o nc \r printing
o zip file appended in image and Image color bits having flag
o zip bomb
o Packet sniffing (keyboard packets? or HTTP traffic?)

-> nsjail (python?)
